    <div class="bodycontent">
        <h2>Relative dating</h2>
        <p>Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science. Geologists still
            use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing
            of geological events.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of uniformitarianism states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the
            Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time. A fundamental principle
            of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that "the present
            is the key to the past." In Hutton's words: "the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be
            seen to be happening now."
        </p>
        <p>The principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous
            intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is
            younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths, batholiths,
            sills and dikes.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences
            through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that
            penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the
            fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations
            may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are
            found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example,
            in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a
            newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies
            are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result,
            xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially
            horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments
            supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded
            units is horizontal).
        </p>
        <p>The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is
            younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip
            beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the
            vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to
            deposition of the highest bed.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms
            exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative
            age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred
            years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession developed
            independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties
            of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in
            sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>Absolute dating</h2>
        <p>Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These dates
            are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate
            relative methods.
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to
            obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This
            changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and
            stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became
            possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil
            sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.
        </p>
        <p>For many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give
            the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point
            at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These
            are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium–lead dating,
            potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating and uranium–thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety
            of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide
            absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative
            dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical
            techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges,
            and paleo-topography.
        </p>
        <p>Fractionation of the lanthanide series elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the
            mantle.
        </p>
        <p>Other methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic radionuclide
            dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the dating of
            landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic carbon.</p>
