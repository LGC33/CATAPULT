        <p>The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational
            processes change their shapes and locations.
        </p>
        <p>Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock.
            Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary
            rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous
            intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and
            crystallize as they intrude.
        </p>
        <p>After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.
            Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side
            (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent
            boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.
        </p>

        <img width="33%" src="img/fault_types.svg" alt="fault_types.svg" role="img" align="left"
             style="padding-right: 10px">

        <p>When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units,
            other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through
            faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which
            causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by
            the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along
            faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged
            along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and
            fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold
            buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms". If the tops of
            the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines,
            respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned
            anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown,
            they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.
        </p>
        <p>Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and metamorphism
            of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the mineral composition of the rocks; creates a foliation,
            or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the original
            textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas, and crystal patterns in
            crystalline rocks.
        </p>
        <p>Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished
            through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that
            are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units.
            Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold and Thrust
            Belt, the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks
            at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch
            into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for "sausage" because of their visual similarity.
        </p>
        <p>Where rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and become shear
            zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.
        </p>
        <p>The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation.
            Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material
            on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments
            are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the
            topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for
            the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity.
            Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long,
            planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are
            being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are
            observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.
        </p>
        <p>All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a
            single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The
            sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United
            States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian
            time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary,
            volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such
            as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have
            been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In
            addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United
            States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then
            deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement
            and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to
            understanding the geological history of an area.</p>
