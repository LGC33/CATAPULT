        <h2>Economic geology</h2>
        <p>Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind uses to
            fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses. Economic
            geologists help locate and manage the Earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as
            mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.</p>

        <h2>Mining geology</h2>
        <p>Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic
            interests include gemstones, metals such as gold and copper, and many minerals such as asbestos, perlite,
            mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine,
            and helium.</p>

        <h2>Petroleum geology</h2>
        <p>Petroleum geologists study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth that can contain extractable
            hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in
            sedimentary basins, they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic
            evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.</p>

        <h2>Engineering geology</h2>
        <p>Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the purpose of
            assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and
            maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed.</p>
        <p>In the field of civil engineering, geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the
            mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without
            collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will
            not settle in clay and mud.</p>

        <h2>Hydrology and environmental issues</h2>
        <p>Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as stream
            restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural
            habitat and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate
            groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important
            in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.</p>
        <p>Geologists also obtain data through stratigraphy, boreholes, core samples, and ice cores. Ice cores and
            sediment cores are used for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and present
            temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These datasets are our primary source of
            information on global climate change outside of instrumental data.</p>

        <h2>Natural hazards</h2>
        <p>Geologists and geophysicists study natural hazards in order to enact safe building codes and warning systems
            that are used to prevent loss of property and life. Examples of important natural hazards that are pertinent
            to geology (as opposed those that are mainly or only pertinent to meteorology) are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Avalanches</li>
            <li>Earthquakes</li>
            <li>Floods</li>
            <li>Landslides and debris flows</li>
            <li>River channel migration and avulsion</li>
            <li>Rockfalls</li>
            <li>Sinkholes</li>
            <li>Soil liquefaction</li>
            <li>Subsidence</li>
            <li>Tsunamis</li>
            <li>Volcanoes</li>
        </ul>
